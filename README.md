## BugBridge is developed using the CodeIgniter 3 framework.
BugBridge is an automated bug tracking application that integrates directly with Cypress, a popular end-to-end testing tool. It automatically captures and documents bugs detected during Cypress test runs, turning test results into a clear, structured bug list.

- With Bugridge, QA teams and developers can:

- Monitor bugs in real-time from automated test runs

- Eliminate manual bug reporting

- Track and manage issues efficiently in a centralized dashboard
